# Project Roles
Throughout the whole project, my main responsibility is to connect our backend and frontend and make sure that they are communicating without errors.
Backend provides API (the data), frontend provides the design of the website. My job is to use data from backend and integrate it into the website and add extra interactive features (Frontend API).

# Contributions
## Website
- Set up the website: 
  - Build the whole backend and frontend structures and folders before starting the project and commit to the GitHub for my teammates to work on.
- Build the login/logout feature for our website.
- Adjusted our database for better usage.
- Update content in the MongoDB compass 
- Build a search API for frontend, can be reuse in both functions (Course Relationship and Course Advisor)
- Connects the data onto the bar charts, make sure it’s synced and updated every time it renders
- Connects the data onto the node graphs, make sure it’s synced and updated every time it renders

## Documentation
- All documentation work is divided evenly for each member. I am responsible for checking all the grammars and the structures. This includes the writeup reports and the scripts we used when demonstrating on zoom or in videos. 
- All work gets a final review by me before submitting.

## GitHub
All codes are committed into GitHub. Each new features will be done on a new branch and will be reviewed by me (including the pull request) and corrected before merging onto our master branch. There are times when team members make a commit on the master branch and leads our website crashing. My job is to fix the crash and bring our website back online.
All the weekly timesheet folders are created and managed by me.
