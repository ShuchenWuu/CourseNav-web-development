Conclusion:
After usability testing, Shuchen found that the course relationship is confusing users. I am planning to separate the data visualisation of dependency and prerequisite.
There are parts in the Business case that need some extra work. The purpose and the exclusive summary of the project are not clear. Some details that are needed to be validated by the client. So we had an extra meeting with our client Nick. Nick also comments on the function, so the user interface of Course Relationship needs to change.
