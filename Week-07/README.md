## Reflection
The way we break down our task is separating back end, front end, and connection back end and front end. So people who take charge of the back or front end should leave enough time for people who connect the back and front end to do the tasks. Shuchen is tested positive for Covid-19. But it did not affect the progress of our project. According to the risk management part of the draft plan, we identified this risk and provided the strategy. Parts of the work Shuchen should done this week is assigned to Lei Jin.
