## Reflection
Yan You is taking charge of the connection frontend and backend; he has a heavy workload, so even though he spent more than average time working, unfinished tasks are still left. We are considering allocating connection jobs to two people in the team. We are facing and trying to fix the problem that some parts of the project can only run in windows but can't run on mac os. So there is a frontend problem that can not be fixed due to this problem.
