## Summary:
We finished all the goals of the week and develop the website as we planed with extra features. We did a final demo presentation with our client Nick, and he is satisfied with the outcome. 
To summarise the whole project, we work with clear goals and roles throughout the development, which is easy for us to decide the tasks allocation. We work, communicate closely, and support each other when needed.
